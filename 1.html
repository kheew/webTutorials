    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta" target="_blank" title="pasta in wikipedia">Pasta (Italian pronunciation: [ˈpasta])</a> is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine, with the first reference dating to 1154 in Sicily.
    Also commonly used to refer to the variety of pasta dishes, pasta is typically made from an unleavened dough of a durum wheat flour mixed with water or eggs and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking.
    As an alternative for those wanting a different taste, or who need to avoid products containing gluten, some pastas can be made using rice flour in place of wheat. Pastas may be divided into two broad categories, dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca).

    Most dried pasta is commercially produced via an extrusion process although it can be produced in most homes.
    Fresh pasta was traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines, but today many varieties of fresh pasta are also commercially produced by large-scale machines, and the products are widely available in supermarkets.
